# Statecraft core

This is the core statecraft repository.

It contains some simple stores and combinators - enough to get started with very few dependancies.

You will probably want to use the statecraft core with other modules to provide interoperability with your data sources, provide network interoperability and so on. These modules are packaged separately to reduce the weight of dependancies in your project.

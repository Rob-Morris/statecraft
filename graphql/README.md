# Statecraft GraphQL support

Eventually I want an official graphql statecraft store whereby stores can explicitly define a graphql schema and then we have a store which wraps a KV / range store, exposing that store via graphql.

Currently this only really exists as a couple experiments. This code may not currently run. It will be expanded on at a later time.
